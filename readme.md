## Design Patterns Dojo ##
This project was created to refine my knowledge of design patterns. In particularlly, the following design patterns:

### Adapter
Adapters can abstract a make collection non-conforming classes confirm to a common abstraction. Can also be a type of wrapper. 

Example:
- ADO .NET
	- IDataAdapter
		- OdbcDataAdapter
		- OleDbDataAdapter
		- SqlClientDataAdapter
	

### Bridge
A way to connect two abstractions so that the concrete implementations are connectioned but can be extended independantly. Two abstract classes, where one composes of the other.
 “Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so the two can vary independently.” (GOF)
